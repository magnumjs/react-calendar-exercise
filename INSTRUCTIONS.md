Exercise:

React Calendar App

 

For this exercise, you are to create a Calendar interface that provides users the ability to manage events.

 

Requirements:

Must use React/Typescript as the implementation language
Cannot use a 3rd party library/component to render the calendar; must be rendered via the application
There needs to be a visual indication on days that have a scheduled event
Selecting a day with a scheduled event needs to show event details somewhere outside of the calendar component
Provide documentation on how to run the application
Tests with a high level of code coverage (your choice of tests and testing frameworks)
Events must include:
Name
Date
Description
 

Guidelines:

Events can be defined in a static file or hard coded
The calendar can only support one event per day
The calendar only needs to show the current month (September)
